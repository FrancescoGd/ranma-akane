RANMA 1/2 BATTLE RENAISSANCE FAQ
Version 1.0 
By-Tu T. Dang Arcadium Operative (tu.dang@m.cc.utah.edu)

Story:
	From what I can tell of the introduction of the game and the 
beginning of the story mode, the gang take a trip.  Its a typical day at 
the Tendo training hall and while everyones chasing everyone else around, 
Kuno offers them the idea of going on a trip.  (I believe the story line 
is similar to the Ranma ½ The Movie 2.  But, Im not exactly sure.)  Kuno's 
family probably bought the island and are building an amusement park 
there. Then some oni (goblin or Japanese troll) is haunting the island 
and involves itself with the group.  From here, each character has their 
own little story that unfolds (for example Ranmas story line is that 
Akane is kidnapped by the oni and he has to go and rescue her).  


Game Play and Control:

The game play is very similar to Tekken 2.  
Each character has the typical moves: 
Right Punch	(RP)
Left Punch	(LP)
Right Kick	(RK)
Left Kick	(LK)
Some characters can rotate themselves in the z-plane.  
Here are some typical moves for everyone.

Downed Opponent:
D+RP
D+LK

Ultimate Techniques:
To do certain special attacks certain conditions must be met
Power Gage Desperation	(PD)  	Your Power meter full to execute this move.
Life Desperation	(LD)  	Your Life meter flashing to do this move.
Super Desperation	(SD)	Your Life meter flashing and Power meter full.
You can fill your Power meter anytime by holding down any attack button.  
Characters are also able to do taunts that will lower the opponents Power 
meter.  But taunts will leave your character defenseless.  
Taunt			(LP+RK)


Ranma Saotome

Story:
	From what I can figure, Akane is kidnapped from the group by the 
oni.  Of course Ranma has go to save her.  In order to defeat the oni, he 
must travel around the island destroying special magical markers that 
will help him defeat and locate the oni.  Of course I cant understand or 
read Japanese, so Im only guessing here.

Akane Tendo

Story:

little payback to the oni and Ranma of course.
