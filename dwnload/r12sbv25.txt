1-0 MISCELLANEOUS GAME INFORMATION

    Basically, info about the game which I wanted to address first, but
    didn't know what to title them under.

1-1 What does the title mean?

    The romanization of the title of this game is "RANMA NIBUNNOICHI: CHOUGI
    RAMBUHEN", Ranma is obviously Ranma's name, "Ni" is 2, "Bun" is parts,
    "No" is of, "Ichi" is 1, "Nibunnoichi" means "1/2".  "Chougi Rambuhen"
    Literally means "Super Skill Wild Dance Chapter".  "Super Battle" is
    pretty close to what it means (or so I'm told).  The series the game is
    based on is called "Ranma 1/2" because Ranma is half male, half female
    (See character descriptions for more details.)

1-2 Is there an U.S. release of the game?

    Um.. no.  Originally, there was a plan for the game to be brought to the
    U.S. under the title "Ranma 1/2: Anything Goes Martial Arts". ("Anything
    Goes Martial Arts" is the style of martial arts that Ranma uses.)
    Unfortuantely, it has never been released.  It is rumored that the game
    was cancelled because Rumiko Takahashi, the artist/author of "Ranma 1/2"
    was not pleased with the voices of the previous port of the game.
    (This piece of info was provided by our ever lost friend--Ryouga!  I
    don't know what I did, but I've lost your e-mail address, Ryouga...  I
    hope you're reading)

    However, there also seems to be evidence to suggest that the game WILL BE
    RELEASED late 1995, as there seems to have been ads for it in Animerica
    around June of 1995.

1-3 What are the codes for the game?

    Like any fighting game, Ranma 1/2: Super Battle would just not be
    complete without some codes of its own.  These are ALL of the codes
    in the game.  Apparently, there are NO turbo codes, and unlike its
    predecessor, you can't get a debug screen between fights to change
    character, nor is there any way to change characters while in story mode.

1-3-1 The Herb Code:

      To use Herb in Story Mode or Vs. Mode, hold down L and R buttons
      before the character selection screen shows up.  In the Vs. Battle
      mode, you can input this code inbetween fights, if you didn't do so
      before you entered Vs. Mode.

1-3-2 Additional Difficulty:

      For two additional difficulty levels, hold L and R and Select while
      pressing start to get to options.

1-4 What are the features of this game?

    Lost your instructions manual?  Can't understand what the Japanese
    instructions are?  Here's inforation that'll help you navigate through
    the different modes of the game.

1-4-1 Tag Game:

      Just like a tag game in a wrestling match...  When you see a small
      life meter appear below yours, that means the tag partner of your
      team (pre-chosen by you, of course) is ready to come in and replace
      your original character. To change characters, simply go to the very
      end of your side, and press "select". Each character's life meter will
      be restored a little bit after they have rested.

1-4-2 Options:

      Pretty self explainatory.  You can choose ahead of time to fight
      against the computer in Vs. Mode.  The "Special" button which can be
      turned on for each player means that you can execute one of the
      special moves of the character that you're using by pressing "R"
      instead of actually performing the special move motion. There are four
      possible colors for each character, and these can be chosen in here as
      well.

1-4-3 Story Mode:

      Who says fighting games don't have plot?

1-4-3-1 Beginning...

        After you've chosen a character for Story Mode, you will get the
        intro story line, in which a generic story is told for each of the
        RANMA fighters (except for HERB)...

        One day _insert name here_ received a letter.

             "This letter brings you an extremely lucky chance!  For over
        four thousand years Jakou-Maneki has held the most valuble of all
        treasures... and now this recipe comes to you.  Maneki Neko can make
        any wish become real is you mix these twelve ingredients.  Now, seek
        the ingredients!"

        Note:  "Maneki Neko" means "Welcome[ing]" or "Beckoning Cat."  It is
               a good luck charm commonly used in Japan, which is supposed to
               attract money.  Different coloring of the cats allegedly are
               supposed to attract different things, such as money (most
               common), good fortune (rather general), or good health.

        Each fighter, after reading the letter, shows their interest, and
        reveals their intention for the Maneki Neko.

          RANMA: To be cured of his curse (have a normal male body again)
          RYOGA: Say goodby to P-CHAN (have a normal male body again)
          MOUSSE: "Hmm... the Maneki Neko of Jako Maneki.  My only wish is
             to become SHAMPOO's groom.  But where are my glasses?"
          SHAMPOO: A date with RANMA
          UKYO: Better business at her okonomiyaki restuarant
          AKANE: Learn how to swim
          MARIKO: "This is a gift from God.  I want to experience the
             wonderful feeling of love!  Fight! M-A-R-I-K-O!  For the sake
             of love, I'll go all out!"
          GENMA: To have a headful of hair
          KUNO: "This presents a problem.  It's only natural that this
             invitation should come to one as good-looking, fine-featured,
             wealthy, modest, strong, brilliant, and wise as myself... but
             there is one thing that troubles my mind:

             `The pigtailed girl... or TENDO AKANE?' That is the question."

          KODACHI: A date with RANMA-sama.

               _Insert name here_ went on the journey...  but _name_ had
        not received the only letter.  _Name_'s rivals were also scattered
        across the world, looking for the secret ingredients.

1-4-3-2 Before reaching Herb...

        That is, after you've defeated all the other characters except Herb,
        he will show up and greet you...

        "Thank you!  You've saved me the trouble of finding the ingredients
        myself!  This is the treasure of Jakou-Maneki.  If you want it, you
        must take it by force! (literally, "knock me down and get it.") If
        by some incredible chance you manage to defeat me, you're more than
        welcome to the treasure"

        "But now, taste the power of the dragon's descendant, master of ki,
        heir to the throne of Jakou-Maneki!"

          To be continued...

1-4-4 Versus Battle

      This one is very simple.  Go in, choose your characters, set your
      attack and defense powers (the more stars you have, the stronger power
      you'll have for attack/defense), choose a color (when playing against
      the same character, you can still choose to have the same colors, so
      you'll have to know which one you are if you decide to choose the same
      color for the same character), choose a stage.


2-0 PLAYING THE GAME

    From general moves to deadly combos, things you need to know to start
    out and master this game.  (And things you might want to know to enjoy
    the game more.)

2-1 General Moves:

    Get down to the basics!

2-1-1 Basic Fighting Techniques

      X - Hard Punch        A - Hard Kick           L - Power Charge/Taunt
      Y - Light Punch       B - Light Punch         R - "Special"

      Moving your character around in Ranma is set up like most of the other
      fighting games (SF2, SS, etc.).  If you are unfamiliar with these
      games, here's a simple layout.  Note that this is for if your
      character is on the left-hand side of the screen, if you're on the
      right hand side, you must invert left and right.

                   Jump   Jump  Jump
                   Back    Up   Forward
                      O    O    O
                       \   |   /

      Move Back/Block O-       -O Move Forward

                       /   |   \
                      O    O    O
              Defensive  Crouch Offensive
                 Crouch         Crouch

2-1-2 Throws and Grabs:

      Each character has a distinct way of throws/grabs (obviously),
      however, in this game, throws and grabs are not as simple as most
      fighting games (SF2, MK, SS, etc.).  While throws and grabs are done
      similar to other fighting games, where you push away or towards, and
      an attack button, the important thing in this game is the distance.
      You can't throw/grab using a certain character because you're too 
      close to your opponent, and obviously if you're too far away from
      your opponent.  All the characters have the ability to either throw
      or grab their opponents.  They will have to be further away from
      their opponents if they are using a weapon as opposed to using their
      bare hands (or feet).  Below is a description of how each character
      can grab/throw their opponents:

      The following are all done with away or towards, plus hard punch (X):
      Ranma (male/female):  Uses his hands as support, and grabs his
           opponent in the upperbody with his feet, and flips him/her
           around. (Close)
      Ryoga:  Grabs his opponent, and slams him/her to the ground, letting
           go half-way to the ground. (Close)
      Mousse:  Grabs his opponent, and leaves a fuse bomb with him/her while
           Mousse runs away. (Mid-close)
      Shampoo:  Similar to what Ryoga does. (Close)
      Ukyo:  Flips her opponent with her giant spatula. (Far)
      Akane:  Back roll. (Close)
      Mariko:  Semi-crouch, grabs with her pom-poms, and throws. (Far)
      Genma:  Suplex. (Close)
      Tatewaki:  Flips 'em with his wooden sword. (Far)
      Kodachi:  Wraps her ribbon around her opponent, and the tosses
           him/her. (Far)
      Hinako (normal):  Hops on her opponent and punches him/her. (Close)
      Hinako (powered up):  Nothing special. (Close)
      Herb: Grabs and toss his opponent with one arm. (Close)

      A few of the characters have something I can't really say would be
      holds (except for Ukyo), which are done by pressing towards and light
      punch, in close range with their opponents.  I've placed these in the
      throws and grabs section, because they, like throws and grabs, cannot
      be blocked, and they make the same sounds as they do when they execute
      their throws/grabs (and because when done with Ukyo, she does do a
      grab).

      Ranma (female):  A small kick to the knee area.
      Shampoo:  A flip kick.
      Ukyo: Grabs and "stabs" opponent with a regular sized spatula.
      Mariko:  Three light hits with her baton.

2-2 Special Moves:

    Now adays, a fighting game just ain't complete without some special
    moves, and (at least) a super move, and Ranma's got 'em!

2-2-1 Super Moves Info...

      Each character has a "Super Move", which can be done when his/her life
      meter is flashing.  To get your life meter to flash, press "L", and
      your character will either perform a taunt or a appear to be charging
      up.  After approximately 1 second, your life meter will begin to
      flash.  Your character is vulnerable when you press "L".

2-2-2 "Special" 

      Special moves with * can be done by pressing "R" if "Special" is
      turned on in the Option mode.  Check "1-4-2 Options" for more info.

2-2-3 Character Specific Special Moves

      The following list of moves, when a direction to the left or right is
      indicated, assumes that the character is on the left side of the
      screen.  If the character is on the right side of the screen, then the
      left and right should be inverted to perform the moves.

2-2-3-01 RANMA SAOTOME (Male)                                  Stage: Hawaii

  The hero of the story.  RANMA turns into a girl when dowsed with cold
  water, and back into a guy when dowsed with hot water (his father's
  fault, but he wasn't born that way).  One of RANMA's greatest weaknesses
  is his fear of cats, a result of a very bad childhood experience (another
  one of his father's faults).  Although RANMA likes AKANE, he is too
  "manly" (or childish) to show his true feelings.
  (See the female RANMA section for more description on the moves.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Hiryu Shoten Ha                | Taught to RANMA by SHAMPOO's grandmother.
(Flying Dragon Ascension Defeat)| By keeping cool and making the opponent
                                | rage, then using temperature difference,
 |  /  O- + PUNCH               | RANMA can create a whirlwind with this
 O O                            | technique
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Moko Takabisha            | Derived from the technique "Roaring Lion 
(Fierce Tiger Domineering) | Ball", RANMA can use the "ki" of his pride to
 |  \  -O  + PUNCH         | create a fireball.
 O   O                     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tenshin Amaguri-Ken    | Yet another technique RANMA learned from SHAMPOO's
(Imperial Broiled Sweet | grandmother.  "Amaguri Ken" is a combination of
    Chestnuts Fist)     | speed, strength, and skill.  RANMA delivers 
 tap PUNCH rapidly      | several quick punches with this move.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tumbling kick   | RANMA rolls a full circle on the ground and delivers a 
 Y + B or X + A  | low kick.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Taunt/Power-up | RANMA hops back and yells, "Yeh, yeh!"
============================================================================
 SUPER MOVE      | "Flying Dragon Descent Projectile",
 Hiryu Korin-dan | An improvement of "Hiryu Shoten Ha", RANMA jumps into the
                 | whirlwind and gathers all the ki that's been scattered
    O            | been scattered about, then pushes them all down towards
 |  |   + X      | his opponent.  This technique was developed while RANMA
 O               | was fighting HERB.
============================================================================


2-2-3-02 RANMA SAOTOME (Female)                                Stage: Hawaii

  RANMA has grown quite accostumed to his female counterpart, and uses his
  female body to his advantage.  (I'll leave the rest up to your
  imagination ^_^;)  The female RANMA is more agile in the game, and has the
  ability to "jump twice"; that is, while in mid-air, the female RANMA and
  jump again (if you press up), although there is nothing for him to jump
  off of.  (See the male RANMA for more info on his moves.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Hiryu Shoten Ha    | A small "whirlwind", which somewhat resembles a  
 (2 sec)  O         | dragon surrounds RANMA, and knocks away anyone who 
    |     |  + KICK | gets in it.
    O               |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Moko Takabisha            | It's a fireball.  Unlike a Ryu/Ken fireball, 
(Fierce Tiger Domineering) | RANMA's Moko Takabisha does not travel a long 
 (2 sec)                   | distance, but may hit twice if you use hard 
   O-    -O  + PUNCH       | punch.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tenshin Amaguri Ken | Similar to Chun-Li's "Lightning Kick" and E. Honda's
                     | "Hundred Hand Slap", except he puches instead of 
 tap PUNCH rapidly   | kicks or slaps.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Elbow roll  | RANMA rolls on the ground, and ends with a low elbow blow.
 X + A       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Backhand  | A turn-around punch.
 Y + B     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Taunt/Power-up | RANMA makes a face and sticks his (her) tongue out.
============================================================================
 SUPER MOVE           | RANMA performs a "Hiryu Shoten Ha" and jumps into
                      | to small tornado, then comes back down upside-down
 O-  /  |  \  -O  + X | with his fist extended and a fireball at his fist
    O   O   O         | to hit his opponent.
============================================================================


2-2-3-03 RYOGA HIBIKI                                      Stage: Antarctica

  RYOGA and RANMA used to go to the same all-boys school, during which time
  they became rivals.  The current relationship between RYOGA and RANMA is
  that of rivals/friends (common among many Japanese martial arts stories).
  When RYOGA is dowsed with cold water, he turns into a little black pig,
  and when dowsed with hot water, he turns back (RANMA and GENMA's fault).
  RYOGA has become quite fond of AKANE, RANMA's fiancee, who doesn't know
  that RYOGA turns into a pig (but knows of all the others in the series who
  change when dowsed with cold water).  RYOGA has a really bad sense of
  direction (Idiot of Directions).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*Bakusai-Ten-Ketsu    | A technique used by people who work with rocks to
(Blasting Point Hole) | remove huge boulders, this technique was taught to
                      | RYOGA by SHAMPOO's grandmother. RYOGA can find the 
  |  /  O-  + PUNCH   | right spot and make a rock blow to tiny little 
  O O                 | pieces.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shishi Hoko-dan      | A technique used by mine-workers to help clear the
 "Roaring Lion Shot"  | tunnel.  RYOGA learned this from a worker when he

  MOUSSE has been in love with SHAMPOO since childhood.  (So it is assumed

  According to their law, if a male outsider defeats one of the village
  girls, she must marry him.  RANMA defeated SHAMPOO (I'll just skip all
  the complications).  SHAMPOO turns into a cat with cold water, and back
  with hot water (her grandmother's fault).  She is after RANMA not only
  because of village law, but also because she's in love with him.  SHAMPOO

2-2-3-06 UKYO KUONJI                                       Stage: Loch Ness
  
  UKYO is a friend from RANMA's childhood, they met while RANMA was
  travelling with his father, training their martial arts.  Because of her
  name and of the way she dressed, RANMA thought she was a guy.  UKYO's
  father knew that UKYO liked RANMA, and arranged their marriage engagement
  with RANMA's father, offering their okonomiyaki (yummy Japanese food)
  food cart (yatai) if they would take care of UKYO.  Being a slave to his
  stomache, GENMA accepted the proposal, but because RANMA was already
  engaged to one of the TENDO girls, GENMA tried to solve the dilemma by
  asking RANMA, "Which do you like better, UKYO or okonomiyaki?"  Being an
  unknowing little kid, RANMA chose okonomiyaki, and UKYO became an abandoned
  bride.  UKYO swore revenge on the SAOTOME father/son; when they met again, 
  UKYO first challenged RANMA, but upon learning all the facts of the story,
  the obvious fact that UKYO still have feelings for RANMA, and the seemingly
  fact that "RANMA and AKANE don't get along," she decided to keep their
  marriage engagement.

  RANMA's fiancee through arrangement made by their perspective fathers
  (SOUN and GENMA), so that they can carry on the Tendo Dojo, as well as
  their unique Anything Goes Martial Arts Style.  AKANE originally hated
  men (except Dr. TOFU), and had many persuers in high school (despite the
  fact that she's sort of a tom-boy), but now likes RANMA (she just has a
  hard time showing her true feelings).  AKANE gets mad easily when
  another girl gets close to RANMA, and is usually slow to listen to reason.
  AKANE has a pet pig, which she calls "P-CHAN" ("p" for pig, and "chan" is
  Japanese for "little"), but does not know that the pig is actually RYOGA.

  A martial arts cheerleader.  MARIKO uses her cheerleading equipment to

  RANMA's father.  GENMA turns into a panda with cold water, and back with
  hot water (RANMA's partially to blame, but mostly his own fault).  GENMA
  enjoys his panda form very much, and is in his panda form almost all the

  concerned to have hair on his bald head.  GENMA also loves to eat, and is

  practices martial-arts-modern-gymnastics.  KODACHI is in love with RANMA,

2-2-3-12 HINAKO NINOMIYA                             Stage: American Prairie

  HINAKO was famous for being able to eliminate juvenile delinquency in high
  schools of bad areas, so Furinkan High's principal (KUNO's father) hired
  her to defeat RANMA.  However, his plans were apparently foiled when he
  found out that HINAKO NINOMIYA looked and behaved like such a little girl;
  little anyone expect that HINAKO possessed the amazing power of draining
  other fighter's fighting ki for her own.

  HINAKO turns into her adult form when she executes her 5 or 50 yen coin
  attack, a technique she learned from HAPPOSAI (GENMA's master) when she
  was young (she doesn't remember HAPPOSAI).  Because the ki of her
  opponents are limited, she does not last too long in her adult form.
  In the game, she turns into her adult form after you press "L" (Power-up).

  Heir to the throne of Jakou-Maneki, an once thought extinct Chinese
  dynasty whose ancestors studied animals as the basis of their martial
  arts, HERB has the genes of a dragon, direct from his ancestors.  HERB
  has two "servants", MINT and LIME, one has the genes of a wolf, the other
  has the genes of a tiger.  Due to an unfortunate (stupid) accident, HERB
  also turns into a girl with cold water, and back with hot water (partially
  a monkey's fault, but mostly his own)... however, since HERB was able to
  go back to China, it is conceivable that he has cured himself of this
  curse (he never showed up in the manga again, so there's no way to know
  for sure).  (Note: Herb doesn't crouch in the game)

2-3 Is there a combo system in this game?

    Of course there is!!  What's a good fighting without it?  The general
    2-in-1 system works in this game, but you have to be more laid-back with
    your timing.  Do the special move when you want it to go off, don't try
    to pre-empt your normal move like you do in SF2.  Below are some
    examples of the combos, many of which are pretty deadly >:), use similar
    tactics for more.

2-3-01 Saotome Ranma Combos

       (Male) Deep jumping kick, standing strong punch, Hiryu Shoten Ha.

       (Female) Deep jumping punch (charging down in midair), crouching
       punch, Hiryu Shoten Ha.


2-3-02 Hibiki Ryoga Combos

       Deep jump fierce kick, standing fierce punch (the uppercut), special
       move.  The jumping headbutt works well and is reliable, but the
       Bakusai-Ten-ketsu and the Shishi Hoko-dan do more damage.

       Deep jump fierce kick, standing fierce punch (uppercut), headbutt,
       special move.

2-3-03 Mousse Combos

       Weak Take-zume Ken, standing strong punch, Knife Throw/Swan Punch.

2-3-04 Shampoo Combos

       Jumping strong punch/kick, standing strong punch, Double Roundhouse
       Kick (YB).

2-3-05 Saotome Genma Combos

       Deep cross-up body splach, low fierce punch, Panda Headbutt.

2-3-06 Kuno Tatewaki Combos

       Deep Jumping firece kick, standing firece kick, special move.

       Deep strong kick, standing strong kick/crouching strong punch,
       Ko-kuu Zan.

2-3-07 Herb Combos

       Deep jumping punch (charging down in midair), crouching strong punch,
       Rising Knife.  (Consecutive use of this combo sometimes cause re-
       dizzies, but it's rare... Besides, your opponent would probably
       already be dead with the third try)


3-0 STORY MODE... Continued

    There's a reason why this is back here instead of in the beginning of
    the FAQ, with the rest of the things that have to do with Story Mode.

3-1 Endings

    That's right, endings!  I thought it might be sort of like a spoiler
    if I included the endings in the beginning of the document, so I've
    placed them here, all the way in the back of the FAQ, just in case.

3-1-01 Ranma Saotome

       Maneki Neko.  Ranma's reaction: "Get that thing away from me!!"
       ...his wish becomes reality.

3-1-02 Ryoga Hibiki

       Instead of making the Maneki Neko, Ryoga gets a MANEKIN.

3-1-03 Mousse

       Mousse created the treasure in accordance with the recipe.

       "Yosh!  With this, I can marry Shampoo!  But where is Maneki Neko?
       Get me my glasses!"
       "Your glasses are here, meow.  Then... meow."
       Maneki Neko's purpose had been achieved, so it left.
       The end.

3-1-04 Shampoo

       Shampoo pulls an unhappy Ranma out for a date.

3-1-05 Ukyo Kuonji

       Ukyo places the Maneki Neko in her store just like a regular maneki
       neko.

3-1-06 Akane Tendo

       In order to get the idol, Akane must mix the ingredients together
       according to the recipe (just like cooking)...

3-1-07 Mariko Konjou

       Mariko made the treasure in accordance with the recipe.
       "Introduce me to the most wonderful person in the world!"
       "The most wonderful guy in the world? <meow>  You're looking at
       him. <meow>"

3-1-08 Genma Saotome

       "Finally, I can wish for luscious hair!!"
       Unfortunately for Genma, he is in his Panda form, and doesn't have
       hot water available to him, so he puts up signs indicating his wish,
       but the cat can't read.

3-1-09 Tatewaki Kuno

       Kuno made the treasure in accordance with the recipe.
       "Bring me the pig-tailed girl and Tendo Akane!"
       "You're too greedy.  You can't have both!"
       "Well... then bring me the pig-tailed girl."

3-1-10 Kodachi Kuno

       "Bring Ranma-sama here!"
       Because she was not as specific as Kuno, and didn't know that
       Kuno's "pig-tailed goddess" is the same person as Ranma, even
       though the female Ranma is right there, she still can't find Ranma.

3-1-11 Hinako Ninomiya

       I want this ... I want that... Hinako pigs out and eats all kinds of
       snacks.

3-1-12 Herb

       Herb created the treasure in accordance with the recipe.

       "As heir to the throne of Jakou-Maneki, I command you!  Serve me
       forever, and let all my wishes become reality!"

       (Maneki Neko cowers in fear)
       "Y... you coward!"
       "I can't help it, sir!"

       So, Maneki Neko became Herb's devoted follower.  As it turned out,
       Herb was the wisest ruler of all.
       THE END.


4-0 FAQ INFORMATION

    Does anythone ever read anything beyond this point?

4-1 Revision History

    v1.0 (??/??/95) My very first attempt at any FAQ, was gonna start from
         scratch, but saw a FAQ at the "Ranma 1/2 Expanded Home Page" (no
         mention of the author), which contained a few errors, so I downloaded
         it, and added information about Options, Tag Game, Story Mode,
         Endings, and slightly modified the Special Moves section.
         Information about the Story and Endings VERY incomplete, names of
         moves are also not that great.  It was then sent out to be placed
         at ftp.netcom.com and the Ranma 1/2 Expanded Home Page.

    v2.0 (04/25/95) Virtually everything in this FAQ was either completely
         new or revised.  Added stuff includes: Table of Contents, meaning
         of the title, Story Mode messages, Versus Battle information,
         character & moves descriptions, some Combos, Ending translations,
         Revision History (can't have this until I've revised it, can I?),
         and an acknowledgment section.  Many of the things added were for
         the benefit of those who may be new to Ranma, or have only
         watched/read the Viz translation of Ranma.

    v2.2 (07/17/95) Acknowledgements sorted in alphabetical order.  Revised
         some info that was already sent to me before v2.0 as complete, but
         was overlooked.  Added info for more combos, and corrected mistake(s)
         in the special moves section.  Actually, all the revisions were done
         quite some time ago, but I didn't think they were enough to get an
         official update release...

    v2.5 (09/17/95) This one!!  Having read through several questions on raa
         regarding the game (especially about if there was or will be a US
         release), I thought it might be wise to post the FAQ again, but also
         realizing that there have been a few more corrections sent to me, I
         decided to make the changes before posting.  Ranma (male) moves
         corrections (can't believe I made the mistakes when changing it from
         plain description to "picture"...  how many more can there be???).
         Additions to the character quotes, info on Maneki Neko, possible US
         release of the game, a few questions answered in more detail, Ukyo's
         character file was slightly modified.  Possibly the final version,
         since there hasn't been more feedback...
